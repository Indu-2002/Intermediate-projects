# Intermediate-projects
This consists of intermediate projects such as Chatbot development and Python Voice assistant using python.
Chatbot Development:
Chatbot development involves creating a computer program that simulates human conversation. Using natural language processing (NLP), chatbots understand and respond to user queries. Developers define the chatbot's purpose, choose technology, design conversation flow, implement code, integrate APIs, test, and deploy.

Python Voice Assistant:
A Python voice assistant is a software program that recognizes spoken commands and responds accordingly. It uses libraries like pyttsx3 for text-to-speech and SpeechRecognition for voice input. Developers set up a TTS engine, implement speech recognition, define functionalities, code user interactions, possibly integrate external services, test, and deploy or run locally.
